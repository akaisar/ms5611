# esp32-ms5611

ESP32 component for the ms5611 sensor, for use with the [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) build framework. 

The ESP32 is a versatile little IoT SoC device that can handle a number of microcontroller tasks for automation and other projects. This component allows the ESP32 to talk with an [MS5611](https://www.te.com/commerce/DocumentDelivery/DDEController?Action=showdoc&DocId=Data+Sheet%7FMS5611-01BA03%7FB3%7Fpdf%7FEnglish%7FENG_DS_MS5611-01BA03_B3.pdf%7FCAT-BLPS0036) temperature and pressure sensor over the I2C bus.

The use of this component is straightfoward. Use MS5611.  Otherwise, you'll mostly be interested in ms5611_update it save temperature and pressure in variable.
